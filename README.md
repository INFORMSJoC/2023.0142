## Description

This repository contains the code to run the experiments present in "The descent-ascent algorithm for DC programming", a bundle method for the unconstrained minimization of nonsmooth difference-of-convex functions. 

## Install
It is needed python 3.11 or above.

Clone or download repository and run shell command as follow:

```
sh ./scripts/install.sh
```

This script install specific packages versions in a python virtualenv.

## Run experiment

Execute the command line:

```
python3 ./scripts/runme.py
```
csv file experiment results will be available in 'results' folder.
## Results
In image below is run result on Apple MacBook Pro 14 mid 2021 with processor Apple silicon M1 Pro.
Python 3.11.5 interpreter.

# AlgorMeter
DADC algorithm is based on AlgorMeter package.  
AlgoMeter is a Python framework for developing, testing, and comparing optimization algorithms. It provides a standard library of DC and convex functions for testing algorithms, as well as integrated performance profiles graphics and other tools.
It is available as pypi package
```
pip install algormeter
```
